## About Me

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from KIIT, graduating in 2022. I love solving complex problems on online platforms and channel my creativity into working on innovative projects.

As an Experienced Software Engineer at Cloudera, I specialize in cloud compute operations, with a strong emphasis on orchestrating Kubernetes and Docker environments with CI/CD tools.
My role involves the efficient management and development of clusters on our internal infrastructure, where I leverage tools such as ansible and proprietary applications.
Having completed a rewarding year at Cloudera, I'm continually motivated by working on efficient cloud solutions that empower our team and organisation.
